#The Idea

This game is an implementation of the idea presented in chapter 9 of Mark J. Guzdial's [*Introduction to Computing and Programming in Python, A Multimedia Approach*](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Introduction-to-Computing-and-Programming-in-Python/9780132923514.page) that is both object-oriented and lame.

#How to play

###Windows

Download and install [Python](http://python.org). Then open a cmd shell (Start Menu > Run > cmd or Start Menu > search cmd), navigate to the folder where you downloaded this, and type `python pyventure.py`.

###Everyone else

Navigate to the folder where you downloaded this in your favorite terminal shell and type `./play`.
